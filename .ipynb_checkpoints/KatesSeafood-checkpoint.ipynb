When I asked if my roll could be toasted the cashier was like okay...I guess I'll ask the chef. How about you just freaking do it?! It's not a hard request and if you are putting lettuce and tomato in my lobster roll I would prefer a lightly toasted bun so my lobster roll isn't soggy. The fries that came with my lobster roll had absolutely no salt on them. I threw them away after trying a couple fries. The fried clams were pretty tasty but then again it's pretty hard to mess up fried clams. I wasn't too keen on the service. When I made a comment to my father in law about the price of the 1/3 pound lobster roll the cashier started to say something like 'well that's why I asked if you wanted the 1/2 pound or 1/3 pound'.

I am a lifelong resident of Cape Cod and grew up eating at Liam\\'s at Nauset Beach. After it washed away in a storm, I switched over to their sister restaurant Kate\\'s, and have spent hundreds if not thousands of dollars at both. Never had a bad experience before. The food Is incredible. Today As we approached the window and older woman came to the window to take our order but I could tell something was \"off\" inside between her and the other employees. I always order the seafood combo but today I asked to order an extra clam fritter (to pay for to take home to my elderly Dad who I care for!!!) and mid sentence she just walked away from the window and instead a young high school girl who was clearly distraught over the older woman came to complete the order. So since the older woman didn\\'t hear my sister walk up behind me and say no get another clam fritter, I think she thought we were asking for free food! I would NEVER!!! So I paid and we went to the pick up window and immediately the older woman yelled at us \"get away from the window we can\\'t work!!), so we backed up but I noticed on the receipts we weren\\'t charged for the fritters so I said \"excuse me miss I think you need to charge me for the clam fritters I don\\'t see it on the order\". She immediately started screaming at us that \"she felt manipulated\", and for us to leave and never come back, and I was so shocked I just asked her \"omg are you ok?\", I just wanted to pay for the fritters. In hindsight she just ASSUMED out of nowhere that we wanted free extras!!! She slammed the door in our face, went to the register and returned our money and told us never come back. I drove home in total shock crying. What a shame. The worst experience I\\'ve ever had a restaurant and now will never take friends, family or myself there again. Horrific!!!As a footnote, she told us she was the owner after we asked for him. Liam O is the owner. If she is, she shouldn\\'t be in customer service.PS in response to your comment, you WERE and ARE \"a f$&king B$&tch\". The way you treated US was the issue, we treated your staff just fine. It was clearly YOU who was mistreating your young staff. She was clearly in tears when we arrived. You should retire because you clearly have mental disturbances occurring.

My last trip to Kate's on 7/16/16 may sadly be my last. We showed up (4 families each spending $60 on the average) and placed our orders. The wait was bit long and when I looked harder it was not hard to tell why. The owner and two young college kids were running the show with maybe one other person on the fryolator, hard to tell. The bickering amongst the staff was clearly visible to all and everyone's food suffered for it. Eventually we got our food and it was just ok, what I was appalled to see was the owner coming out amidst all of the confusion and giving paying customers a hard time about moving picnic tables into the shade. To the point of being so abusive and rude that a lady ahead of me was nearly in tears over it.The overflowing porta potty out back, the greasy dumpster and grease spots all over the parking lot tell half the story. The rest is above. Save your money and go to the Brewster Scoop for ice cream and the Brewster Fish House for chowder and anything else.For The Owners: Good customer service costs you nothing. Poor customer service will cost you everything. Nothing else to be said, I'm sure your till will reflect it if you don't want to take my word for it.\"},\n",

Be warned if you get this sandwich it's basically a plain mouthful of bread, lettuce, and tomato. I know it's the Cape and things are more expensive but if you're going to charge $7.00 for a grilled chicken sandwich the piece of chicken should be within reason.The onion rings (sm-$4.49) were very tasty.I also got the Black Raspberry Chip frozen yogurt (sm-$3.99) which was very good. I will return in the future, but will most likely not purchase the grilled chicken sandwich.\"},\n",

We were excited that they started serving gluten-free food when three of us were diagnosed with celiac. Unfortunately, last night they gave us our lobster roll on a conventional bun instead of a gluten-free roll, despite our clear instructions. Midway through the bun, my mother declared it the best gluten-free bun she'd ever had. That was our tip-off that it wasn't gluten-free! After a night of non-stop vomiting, my mom is finally feeling better. We really appreciate the effort to accommodate special dietary needs, but we hope they'll take greater care with these orders if they want to offer such a nice service in the future.
